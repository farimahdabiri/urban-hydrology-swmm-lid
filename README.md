# Urban Hydrology Modelling with SWMM and LID Scenarios

This repository presents an academic project focused on urban hydrology modelling and flood risk assessment using the EPA Storm Water Management Model (SWMM). The project evaluates the performance of Low Impact Development (LID) strategies in mitigating urban runoff under different rainfall scenarios.

## Project Objectives
- Model urban runoff dynamics using SWMM
- Assess flood extent and hydrological response under baseline conditions
- Evaluate the effectiveness of LID strategies in reducing surface runoff and peak flows
- Support data-driven and scenario-based decision-making for urban flood mitigation

## Study Area and Data
- Urban catchment with mixed land-use characteristics
- Rainfall inputs derived from observed or design storm events
- Spatial inputs prepared using GIS-based preprocessing

## Methodology
1. Delineation of sub-catchments and drainage network
2. SWMM model setup and calibration
3. Simulation of baseline (no-LID) hydrological conditions
4. Implementation of LID scenarios (e.g., green roofs, permeable pavements)
5. Comparative analysis of runoff volume, peak discharge, and flood response

## Tools and Technologies
- EPA SWMM
- GIS (QGIS)
- Spatial data preprocessing
- Scenario-based hydrological modelling

## Key Outcomes
- Quantitative comparison of runoff reduction across scenarios
- Improved understanding of LID impacts on urban flood mitigation
- Demonstration of integrated GIS–hydrological modelling workflow

## Academic Context
This project was developed as part of a university-level course/research activity in urban hydrology and environmental modelling. It demonstrates applied skills in hydrological simulation, spatial analysis, and scenario-based assessment relevant to climate-resilient infrastructure planning.
