# Urban Hydrology Modelling with SWMM and LID Scenarios

This repository presents an academic project focused on urban hydrology modelling and flood risk assessment using the EPA Storm Water Management Model (SWMM). The project evaluates the performance of Low Impact Development (LID) strategies in mitigating urban runoff under different rainfall scenarios.

## Project Objectives
- Model urban runoff dynamics using SWMM
- Assess flood extent and hydrological response under baseline conditions
- Evaluate the effectiveness of LID strategies in reducing surface runoff and peak flows
- Support data-driven and scenario-based decision-making for urban flood mitigation

## Study Area and Data
- Urban catchment with mixed land-use characteristics
- Rainfall inputs derived from observed or design storm events
- Spatial inputs prepared using GIS-based preprocessing

## Methodology
1. Delineation of sub-catchments and drainage network
2. SWMM model setup and calibration
3. Simulation of baseline (no-LID) hydrological conditions
4. Implementation of LID scenarios (e.g., green roofs, permeable pavements)
5. Comparative analysis of runoff volume, peak discharge, and flood response
